All the pions are generated from the degrader with the usual multiplicity and spectrum.

I generated 10^5 annihilation and obtained the following geometric efficiency for the "OR"

0.193 +/- 0.001

This means that if you get 10000 counts in your dump, you have annihilated ~51800 pbars.

So we trap something like 250k antiprotons per shot in Nov 26 2016.
